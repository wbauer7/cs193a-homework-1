CS193A Hangman
--------------
In this game, the computer chooses a word at random and you must reveal it by guessing letters. Thank the CS 106B _Boggle_ dictionary for all the words you've never seen before!

Notes:
   * The game may take a few minutes to load at first (it's reading in the dictionary)
   * Incorrect guesses may cause a momentary lag (that's a bug!)
   * The UI should scale fairly well to other screens, but it has been tested on:
    * A 5.96 inch display at 2,560 x 1,440 pixels
    * An 8.9 inch display at 2,048 x 1,536 pixels
   * The game reloads when switching between portrait and landscape orientations (that's a bug!)
   * The hangman graphic may be difficult to see on some screens
